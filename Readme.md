# Java Basics and Arrays HW

## Java basics

Follow these steps:
* Create a new file called factorial.java

* Write a program that determines the factorial of a number entered by a user.

* Prompt the user to enter a positive integer.

* Then calculate the factorial of the given number. For any positive integer n, its factorial is given by:
    * factorial = 1*2*3...*n

* Finally, print out the factorial.

## Arrays 

Follow these steps:
* Create a new file called sumElements.java

* Write a program that returns the sum of all elements in a specified column of a two-dimensional array.

* Firstly ask the user to enter a 3-by-4 array The user should enter the array
as follows: 2.6 5.1 6 8 5.4 4.4 7 1 9.5 7.9 2 3

* The program should then calculate the sum of each column in the array.
